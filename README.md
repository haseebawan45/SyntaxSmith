## Design Philosophy

SyntaxSmith follows these core design principles:

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture and emphasis on learning content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complexity gradually as learners gain confidence
- **Feedback Loops**: Provide immediate, actionable feedback on code exercises
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for an inclusive learning experience
- **Performance**: Optimized load times and smooth interactions across devices
- **Delight**: Thoughtful animations and micro-interactions that enhance, not distract

## Technology Stack

- HTML5 for semantic markup
- CSS3 with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Mobile-first responsive design

No build process is required for basic viewing of the static prototype.

## Future Development

- Full implementation of remaining pages
- Backend integration for user accounts and progress tracking
- Interactive code editor with real-time compilation/execution
- Community features (comments, sharing, user profiles)
- Content management system for creating/editing lessons
